abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have become essential components for a variety of environmental, surveillance, military, traffic control, and healthcare applications. These applications face critical challenges such as communication, security, power consumption, data aggregation, heterogeneities of sensor hardware, and Quality of Service (QoS) issues. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a software architecture that can be integrated with WSN applications to address those challenges. The SOA middleware bridges the gap between the high-level requirements of different applications and the hardware constraints of WSNs. This survey explores state-of-the-art approaches based on SOA and Service-Oriented Middleware (SOM) architecture that provide solutions for WSN challenges. The categories of this paper are based on approaches of SOA with and without middleware for WSNs. Additionally, features of SOA and middleware architectures for WSNs are compared to achieve more robust and efficient network performance. Design issues of SOA middleware for WSNs and its characteristics are also highlighted. The paper concludes with future research directions in SOM architecture to meet all requirements of emerging application of WSNs.},

abstract = {Nowadays many systems with diverse technologies such as (GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, Ultra Wide Band, Ultrasounds, Infrared, etc) can be used for indoor location. One of the biggest challenges in indoor location systems is to determine the actual indoor position of the user using a smart device (Phone, PC, etc), due to their instability, cost, high-power consumption, low accuracy and low precision. To overcome those problems, we have designed, implemented and emulated an indoor location system based on RSSI (Receive Signal Strength indicator) of the Bluetooth low energy 4.0 (BLE). BLE 4.0 technology is more advantageous in terms of long life expectancy, our approach is based on the deployment of equidistant nodes on the ceiling. The nodes are programmed to broadcast a periodic beacon at a time pace of 400ms and then to enter sleep mode. When a smart device enters within the broadcasting range, it locates the three access points (nodes) with the highest signal strength. This information can be calculated using one of the several localization algorithms (Dilatation). The proposed Dilatation algorithm can be easily implemented in the hardware due to its low complexity, the method can be successful even when using a few numbers of nodes. In average the system has about 0.5 ∼ 1 meters of error.},

abstract = {The recent introduction of digital mobile technologies in society and especially among young people is a challenge for teachers, and it could represent an opportunity for greater academic achievement. This article presents research on the educational use of Geolocation and Augmented Reality applications with mobile digital devices in Secondary Education and Vocational Training educational stages. This investigation tries to find out if it is possible to use these technologies on students' mobile devices to reach a better education. The paper begins with a review of these developments from a formative dimension. Then, a macro descriptive and quantitative study of 1,832 students is developed in order to determine what type of digital devices they have, subsequently teachers' views about functionality and educational value of digital devices are analyzed. The results clarify the type and penetration of these devices in the three educational stages analyzed, and the data suggests the possibility of implementing these technologies as students' devices have advanced operating systems and appropriate GPS hardware. From the teachers' perspective, the reluctance to use these devices can be overcome with an initial integration of tasks outside the school and in non-contact activities. Together with the m-learning characteristics of spatiotemporal delocalization, innovative features arise in educational methodology derived from systems that drive noncompetitive collaborative relationships. Augmented Reality appears as a motivating power element in the educational tasks, opening doors to autonomous, non-linear exploration of virtual worlds that now incorporate a high surprise component for the user. On the other hand, Geolocation serves in the exploration of work environments, geo-spatial referencing, and individualized monitoring of distance tasks.},

Such systems have been successfully adopted in the context of wireless emergency services, tactical military operations, and various other applications offering location-based services. In current and previous generation of cellular systems, i.e., 3G, 4G, and LTE, the base stations, which have known locations, have been assumed to be stationary and fixed. However, with the possibility of having mobile relays in 5G networks, there is a demand for novel algorithms that address the challenges that did not exist in the previous generations of localization systems. This paper includes a review of various fundamental techniques, current trends, and state-of-the-art systems and algorithms employed in wireless position estimation using moving receivers. Subsequently, performance criteria comparisons are given for the aforementioned techniques and systems. Moreover, a discussion addressing potential research directions when dealing with moving receivers, e.g., receiver's movement pattern for efficient and accurate localization, non-line-of-sight problem, sensor fusion, and cooperative localization, is briefly given.},

A metric to evaluate the extent to which the architectural design is modifiable is defined and formulated. The number of direct connections between the components and their modes of operation are the various factors that will determine the extent to which the architectural design is modifiable. The model has been tested successfully for a prototype document processing application system. The composite architectural design is quite generic and it can be used for any real-time application system where the three modes of operation – data stream mode, user interaction and dynamic invocation mode exist together.},

In the smart industry, there are many types of devices connected to the Internet of Things, and the data format of the devices is not uniform. Therefore, when the upper layer application collects device data and manages the devices, it is necessary to introduce middleware to solve these problems. A service-oriented IoT middleware model is designed. This middleware is built on the background of the smart campus with the above characteristics. The middleware is responsible for realizing the information interaction between the front-end sensing device and the upper-layer application, sending the commands of the upper-layer application to the device to implement real-time management of the device and providing a heterogeneous intelligent device for accessing the Internet of Things application environment, an effective solution.

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) aims to connect the real world made up of devices, sensors and actuators to the virtual world of Internet in order to interconnect devices with each other generating information from the gathered data. Devices, in general, have limited computational power and limited storage capacity. Cloud Computing (CC) has virtually unlimited capacity in terms of storage and computing power, and is based on sharing resources. Therefore, the integration between IoT and CC seems to be one of the most promising solutions. In fact, many of the biggest companies that offer Cloud Services are focusing on the IoT world to offer services also in this direction to their users. In this paper we compare the three main Cloud Platforms (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure) regarding to the services made available for the IoT. After describing the typical architecture of an IoT application, we map the Cloud-IoT Platforms services with this architecture analyzing the key points for each platform. At the same time, in order to conduct a comparative analysis of performance, we focus on a service made available by all platforms (MQTT middleware) building the reference scenarios and the metrics to be taken into account. Finally, we provide an overview of platform costs based on different loads. The aim is not to declare a winner, but to provide a useful tool to developers to make an informed choice of a platform depending on the use case.},

abstract = {The concept of Smart Buildings was introduced by the Energy Performance Building Directive, with the aim to promote energy flexibility, renewable energy production and user interaction. A wide range of definitions have been introduced in the literature to characterize smart buildings yet, at present, its' concept and features are not clearly and uniquely defined. Simultaneously, building energy retrofit concept has been introduced to facilitate achieving the nearly Zero-Energy Building target and reduce energy consumption in existing buildings. Up to 90 % of the existing European building stock will still be standing and in use in 2050. Thus, there is a need to upgrade the existing retrofitting strategies into Smart Retrofitting, to achieve the nearly Zero Energy Building target and be able to respond to external dynamic conditions such as the weather and the grid. The aim of this research is first to review the concept of smartness in the built environment, highlighting the main features, functions, and technologies of smart buildings, also discussing the possible challenges for smart retrofit applications. The second part of the paper reviews the existing Key Performance Indicators that measure the performance and success in achieving goals in smart buildings. The need to develop a quantified guideline to improve energy and technological innovation is the basis for the increase of the smartness in buildings. Consequently, a set of nine groups of representative performance indicators for smart buildings is developed. This work shows current gaps in the literature and highlights the space for foreseeable future research.},

abstract = {Because human activities impact the timing, location, and degree of pollutant exposure, they play a key role in explaining exposure variation. This fact has motivated the collection of activity pattern data for their specific use in exposure assessments. The largest of these recent efforts is the National Human Activity Pattern Survey (NHAPS), a 2 -year probability-based telephone survey (n = 9386) of exposure-related human activities in the United States (U.S.) sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The primary purpose of NHAPS was to provide comprehensive and current exposure information over broad geographical and temporal scales, particularly for use in probabilistic population exposure models. NHAPS was conducted on a virtually daily basis from late September 1992 through September 1994 by the University of Maryland's Survey Research Center using a computer-assisted telephone interview instrument (CAT1) to collect 24-h retrospective diaries and answers to a number of personal and exposure-related questions from each respondent. The resulting diary records contain beginning and ending times for each distinct combination of location and activity occurring on the diary day (i.e., each microenvironment). Between 340 and 1713 respondents of all ages were interviewed in each of the 10 EPA regions across the 48 contiguous states. Interviews were completed in 63% of the households contacted. NHAPS respondents reported spending an average of 87% of their time in enclosed buildings and about 6% of their time in enclosed vehicles. These proportions are fairly constant across the various regions of the U.S. and Canada and for the California population between the late 1980s, when the California Air Resources Board (CARB) sponsored a state-wide activity pattern study, and the mid- 1990s, when NHAPS was conducted. However, the number of people exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in California seems to have decreased over the same time period, where exposure is determined by the reported time spent with a smoker. In both California and the entire nation, the most time spent exposed to ETS was reported to take place in residential locations.},
