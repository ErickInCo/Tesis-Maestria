abstract = {Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) are two communication protocol standards that define a physical layer and a MAC layer for wireless communications within a short range (from a few meters up to 100 m) with low power consumption (from less than 1 m W up to 100 mW). Bluetooth is oriented to connecting close devices, serving as a substitute for cables, while Wi-Fi is oriented toward computer-to-computer connections, as an extension of or substitution for cabled LANs. In this article we offer an overview of these popular wireless communication standards, comparing their main features and behaviors in terms of various metrics, including capacity, network topology, security, quality of service support, and power consumption.},

Their applications include real-time tracking, activity recognition, health care, navigation, emergence detection, and target-of-interest monitoring, among others. Additionally, indoor localization technologies address the inefficiency of GPS (Global Positioning System) inside buildings. Since people spend most of their time in indoor environments, indoor tracking service is in great public demand. Based on this observation, this paper aims to provide a better understanding of state-of-the-art technologies and stimulate new research efforts in this field. For these purposes, existing localization technologies that can be used for tracking individuals in indoor environments are reviewed, along with some further discussions. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {In recent years, the evolution of urban environments, jointly with the progress of the Information and Communication sector, have enabled the rapid adoption of new solutions that contribute to the growth in popularity of Smart Cities. Currently, the majority of the world population lives in cities encouraging different stakeholders within these innovative ecosystems to seek new solutions guaranteeing the sustainability and efficiency of such complex environments. In this work, it is discussed how the experimentation with IoT technologies and other data sources form the cities can be utilized to co-create in the OrganiCity project, where key actors like citizens, researchers and other stakeholders shape smart city services and applications in a collaborative fashion. Furthermore, a novel architecture is proposed that enables this organic growth of the future cities, facilitating the experimentation that tailors the adoption of new technologies and services for a better quality of life, as well as agile and dynamic mechanisms for managing cities. In this work, the different components and enablers of the OrganiCity platform are presented and discussed in detail and include, among others, a portal to manage the experiment life cycle, an Urban Data Observatory to explore data assets, and an annotations component to indicate quality of data, with a particular focus on the city-scale opportunistic data collection service operating as an alternative to traditional communications.},

abstract = {Employment of ground-based positioning systems has been consistently growing over the past decades due to the growing number of applications that require location information where the conventional satellite-based systems have limitations. Such systems have been successfully adopted in the context of wireless emergency services, tactical military operations, and various other applications offering location-based services. In current and previous generation of cellular systems, i.e., 3G, 4G, and LTE, the base stations, which have known locations, have been assumed to be stationary and fixed. However, with the possibility of having mobile relays in 5G networks, there is a demand for novel algorithms that address the challenges that did not exist in the previous generations of localization systems. This paper includes a review of various fundamental techniques, current trends, and state-of-the-art systems and algorithms employed in wireless position estimation using moving receivers. Subsequently, performance criteria comparisons are given for the aforementioned techniques and systems. Moreover, a discussion addressing potential research directions when dealing with moving receivers, e.g., receiver's movement pattern for efficient and accurate localization, non-line-of-sight problem, sensor fusion, and cooperative localization, is briefly given.},

The approaches include Wi-Fi and Bluetooth based positioning, magnetic field fingerprinting, map aided navigation using building floor plans, and aiding from self-contained sensors. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth based positioning methods considered in this survey are fingerprint approaches that determine a user's position using a database of radio signal strength measurements that were collected earlier at known locations. Magnetic field fingerprinting can be used in an information fusion algorithm to improve positioning. The map-matching algorithms include application of wall constraints, topological indoor maps, and building geometry for heading correction. Finally, methods for step counting, step length and direction estimation, orientation tracking, motion classification, transit mode detection, and floor change detection in multi-storey buildings are discussed.},

There is currently a wealth of relevant literature on indoor localization. This article focuses on recent advances in indoor localization methods that use spatial context to improve the location estimation. Spatial context in the form of maps and spatial models have been used to improve the localization by constraining location estimates in the navigable parts of indoor environments. Landmarks such as doors and corners, which are also one form of spatial context, have proved useful in assisting indoor localization by correcting the localization error. This survey gives a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art indoor localization methods and localization improvement methods using maps, spatial models, and landmarks.},

The intelligent layer which is added over the physical one is bringing a change in the mode in which the electricity is provided. Hence, the electricity providers are shifting their business from product-centered to service-centered ones, change that ensure a better use of their resources and a much wider acceptance from their customers. The wave of changes has reached the construction domain, and therefore the buildings have evolved into smart buildings, concept which offers a greater elasticity for both energy providers and end-users.

@article{Klepeis2001,
abstract = {Because human activities impact the timing, location, and degree of pollutant exposure, they play a key role in explaining exposure variation. This fact has motivated the collection of activity pattern data for their specific use in exposure assessments. The largest of these recent efforts is the National Human Activity Pattern Survey (NHAPS), a 2 -year probability-based telephone survey (n = 9386) of exposure-related human activities in the United States (U.S.) sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The primary purpose of NHAPS was to provide comprehensive and current exposure information over broad geographical and temporal scales, particularly for use in probabilistic population exposure models. NHAPS was conducted on a virtually daily basis from late September 1992 through September 1994 by the University of Maryland's Survey Research Center using a computer-assisted telephone interview instrument (CAT1) to collect 24-h retrospective diaries and answers to a number of personal and exposure-related questions from each respondent. The resulting diary records contain beginning and ending times for each distinct combination of location and activity occurring on the diary day (i.e., each microenvironment). Between 340 and 1713 respondents of all ages were interviewed in each of the 10 EPA regions across the 48 contiguous states. Interviews were completed in 63% of the households contacted. NHAPS respondents reported spending an average of 87% of their time in enclosed buildings and about 6% of their time in enclosed vehicles. These proportions are fairly constant across the various regions of the U.S. and Canada and for the California population between the late 1980s, when the California Air Resources Board (CARB) sponsored a state-wide activity pattern study, and the mid- 1990s, when NHAPS was conducted. However, the number of people exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in California seems to have decreased over the same time period, where exposure is determined by the reported time spent with a smoker. In both California and the entire nation, the most time spent exposed to ETS was reported to take place in residential locations.},
